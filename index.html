        <h1>Hello, World!</h1>
        <p>Named Arman and spawned in 01, in an island in the Persian gulf then moving to a northern city in Iran, i was extremely interested in mechanics and electronics from early childhood.</p>
        <p>I got to work with my first computer when i was 6, it was a Pentium with one gig of ram, which was interestingly very powerful for any game back in the day. I loved it as you may have already guessed. I used to do my homework just to ask my mom to play with my pc as a reward. My days went on with playing games and listening to music and watching movies, untill it wasn't fun anymore, so i wanted to do something more interesting and open it up to see how does it work inside, of course my mom wasn't going to be happy at all because i was known to destroy any electric appliance that came to my vicinity so i set up a plan, i would break it intentionaly! and that was how i got premission to open up my pc to try to "repair" it, and therefore it was my first computer repair im my life :)</p>
        <p>I'm interested in any matter of networking, wireless and wired especially fiber optics, </p>
